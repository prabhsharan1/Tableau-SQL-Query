# Tableau SQL Queries for COVID-19 Data Exploration

This repository contains SQL queries used for the Tableau project focusing on exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data. The queries utilize Microsoft SQL Server and are designed to provide insights into various aspects, including infection rates, death rates, and population percentages. These queries serve as the foundation for the visualizations created in Tableau.

## Queries Overview

### 1. Global COVID-19 Statistics

- Calculate global statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and death percentage.

### 2. Total Death Count by Location

### 3. Countries with Highest Infection Rate
- Identify countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.

### 4. Infection Rate Over Time
- Analyze infection rates over time for each location.

### 5. Additional Queries
- Explore more insights with additional queries covering aspects such as global numbers, death rates, and more.
